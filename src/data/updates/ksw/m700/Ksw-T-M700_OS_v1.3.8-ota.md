Summary:
- Zlink updated to `5.4.54`
- New [`EVOID9_ALS`](/headunits/themes/ksw/evoid9_als) and [`EVOID8_UG_2mode`](/headunits/themes/ksw/evoid8_ug_2mode) themes

Changes since `Ksw-T-M700_OS_v1.3.5-ota` built 14 days earlier:
- Zlink updated from `5.4.53` to `5.4.54`
- New [`EVOID9_ALS`](/headunits/themes/ksw/evoid9_als) theme
    - It will have the following modes to switch between: Comfort, Elegant, Mystery, Noble, Passionate, Steady, Vitality
    - It will have a wallpaper selection, including a "personalised wallpaper" and some sort of "real-time speed" functionality
    - Ability to select a free form app to be drawn similarly to ID8 theme, set to Google Maps by default (if present)
    - There's going to be a new internal setting about a free window radius, perhaps something to do with how the free-floating app looks like between ID8 and ID9 themes going forward
    - It's likely that the Home button will (re)activate that floating app
    - Most apps like Launcher, CenterService, Music, Video, Equalizer, Bluetooth, have initial support for this theme now, it appears fairly safe to apply by now, but it has not been tested.
- New [`EVOID8_UG_2mode`](/headunits/themes/ksw/evoid8_ug_2mode) theme
- New aux settings screen on MBUX themes (?)
