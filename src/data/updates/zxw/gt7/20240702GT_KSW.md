Summary:
- TODO

Changes since `20240525GT_KSW`:
- Zlink updated from 5.4.43 to 5.4.45 (zhuoxw channel)
- Changed `ro.build.display.id` from `GT7-EAU-T16.000500-[…]` to `GT7-GL-[…]`
- Added `etc/zxw_config.xml` file, contents include customer name set to `KSW` and `UIStyle` set to `BBA`. This appears to be used for new "VendorConfigs".
- Mentions of `GT7PRO` with SD685/SM6225-AD (same as KSW M785) and `GT7` with SD680/SM6225 (same as KSW M700)
- CustomerUI has new tricks, like a new Zlink socket service that's deciphering playback/media/navigation/phone statuses. There's lots, lots other interesting models, events, etc. that custom app developers might want to dig into.
- More to come another time.
