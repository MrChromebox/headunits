Summary:
- New theme [`KSW_BMW_ID8_KJD`](/headunits/themes/zxw/47-ksw_bmw_id8_kjd) with ID `47`
- New theme [`KSW_BENZ_LS`](/headunits/themes/zxw/48-ksw_benz_ls) with ID `48` (under development)
- New BT Transmission app hidden behind new "USB BT transmit" factory setting `<btTransmitVisible>`
- New factory setting "Automatically enter navigation upon startup" `<bootStartNavi>`

Changes since `20240829GT_KSW` built 3 weeks earlier:
- Theme [`KSW_BMW_ID8_KJD`](/headunits/themes/zxw/47-ksw_bmw_id8_kjd) with `id="47"` introduced across most of the built-in apps with graphics and lots of duplicated code, mostly to handle its own images over the standard [`KSW_BMW_ID8`](/headunits/themes/zxw/17-ksw_bmw_id8).
- Theme [`KSW_BENZ_LS`](/headunits/themes/zxw/48-ksw_benz_ls) with `id="48"` seems to be still under development as this firmware update does not seem to have any graphics and custom logic for it yet.
- Ivicar app: The "Non-reverse Picture-in-Picture trigger" setting has been changed to be enabled by default
- CustomerUI app: New `CONTROL_DISPLAY_BRIGHTNESS` permission and ability to change screen brightness
- CustomerUI app: Drag & drop apps to create shortcuts (?)
- TestTools app: New diagnostics around LED light and MCU checks
- New app called "BT Transmission" with package name `com.szchoiceway.transmitbt`, seems to have `LOCAL_MAC_ADDRESS` permission and a background service. By looking at graphics and labels, functionality appears to be around scanning for and connecting to a USB Bluetooth device, including pairing, using a PIN code, changing volume, etc. There seems to be functionality around upgrading firmware of the Bluetooth module with OTA files, also mentioning "performing the upgrade oparation on your mobile phone".
- UpdateMCU app updated with retry mechanism (up to 3 times) and detection of upgrade interruption
- Beware, lost of apps have some new metadata and seem to say they were built for GT7 flavour, even though this firmware is for GT6. Not sure if this could/would cause some trouble.
