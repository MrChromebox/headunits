Summary:
- New themes [`KSW_BMW_ID8_BFD`](/headunits/themes/zxw/49-ksw_bmw_id8_bfd) and [`KSW_BMW_ID7_800`](/headunits/themes/zxw/50-ksw_bmw_id7_800), both still under development
- New night brightness setting
- Ukrainian language option

Changes since `20240919GT_KSW` built one month earlier:
- Theme [`KSW_BMW_ID8_BFD`](/headunits/themes/zxw/49-ksw_bmw_id8_bfd) with `id="49"` starts to appear in various places, still under development. The `BFD` string seems to be a possible client setting as well, similar to existing `ALS_6208`, `GS` and others. It's certainly possible that this new theme will only work when such `BFD` client setting is present.
- Theme [`KSW_BMW_ID7_800`](/headunits/themes/zxw/60-ksw_bmw_id7_800) with `id="50"` starts to appear in even less places, still under development
- Theme [`KSW_BENZ_LS`](/headunits/themes/zxw/48-ksw_benz_ls) with `id="48"` has now more graphics and support across apps, it might be now almost safe to activate it
- Added Ukrainian language option with ID `20`
- New factory setting "Night brightness bar" in the "Function" section, with variables `<backlightBrightnessNightShow>` and `<backlightBrightnessNight>` to configure via config XML file
- New factory setting `<AnOffset>` (?)
