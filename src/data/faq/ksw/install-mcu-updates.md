question: 'How to install MCU updates?'
---
1. Find out the exact version of your current MCU on your System Information screen in Settings
2. Find if there are any updates available on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/702437587679313920/721937254439845921/735870449577361512) where everything apart from a date is the same
3. Extract the ZIP archive if necessary
3. Copy the `ksw_mcu.bin` file directly to the root of the FAT32 formatted USB drive
4. Plug in the USB drive into Head Unit (if you have two USB connectors, use the one without CarPlay label)
5. Go to Settings, System Information and select MCU upgrade
