This is the first firmware we're aware of, so here are differences between this ZXW firmware and older KSW A12 `Ksw-S-M600-OS_v1.5.4NEXAI-ota`:

- Built in release mode (`release-keys`) that [prevents tampering](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/sign_builds#release-keys)

- Missing KSW apps
  - in `system/app`: APKInstaller, KswAirConditioner, KswPLauncher, KswPMusic, KSWPVideo, WitsLogcat, kswEq
  - in `system/PreInstall`: AutoMap, CarCare, CarplayZlink, DAB-Z, KugouAuto, TXZOverSeaAdapter, TingCar3.0, WitsScreencast, qqmusiccar, sogouInput
  - in `system/priv-app`: AppManager, Ecar_SOS, FactoryKit, KswBt, TXZAIPal, TXZCore, TXZOta, TXZWeather, WitsShell

- New apps
  - in `system/app`
    - CarLetter (`com.carletter.car`) app version `7.3.6.20230711`
      - Developed by company "CarAuto", looks like equivalent of Zlink:
        - Android Auto (wired and wireless)
        - Apple CarPlay (wired and wireless)
        - Apple AirPlay screen mirroring (wireless hotspot)
        - Carletter Cast (bluetooth and wireless hotspot)
        - DLNA screencasting (wireless hotspot, both Android/iOS)
        - CarLife (wired and wireless)
        - Huawei HiCar (bluetooth)
      - Automatic software updates when connected to the internet
      - Requires six digit activation code
      - Default hotspot is SSID `carletter` with password `12345678`.
      - Weirdly has this CarLetter stuff, but device's "Bluetooth manufacturer interface name" is set to `zlink_5`.
      - User interface configuration file `etc/carletter.prop` with the following interesting bits:
        - The "customer platform" is set to `ZXW-6125-02`
        - There's an "activation type" that looks like base64 encoded string, but ends up more like a binary code: `ACTIVATION_TYPE=P+Auul9NJekHowQfXS/g0jVjYDLUpSzGloLvkMH7P/bWoXPM5i02mxeXqGFWmMPYimUIrof6Rddo5IUaRLylOfevDUbyTd00czMf8KToP7rQTvLiuSZ+KQ1ZJPRWYBDk83X6WIejbomMUC0n836xoCZyScoMSrlA7zfSgGrJ0io=`
        - There are various settings for the "internet menu options":
          - `ALL` - Full functionality (Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Huawei HiCar, Carlife)
          - `OVERSEAS_VERSION` - Overseas version (Apple CarPlay, Android Auto) _set in this firmware file_
          - `DOMESTIC_EDITION` - Domestic version (Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Huawei HiCar)
          - `WITH_LANGUAGE` - Depending on language setting, where Chinese would trigger domestic edition and all other languages would trigger overseas version
          - `CARPLAY_CARLIFE` - Apple CarPlay, Carlife
        - There is a setting for either landscape or portrait screen mode
    - ExtShared (`android.ext.shared`) app version `1` that does absolutely nothing
  - in `system/priv-app`:
    - Shell (`com.android.shell`) app
      - Presumably in place of KSW's WitsShell app
      - User facing functionality seems to be just about bug reporting that can attach screenshots
    - StatementService (`com.android.statementservice`) app version `1.0`
    - SysVarProvider (`com.szchoiceway.providers.settings`) app version `12`
      - Basically a third party library, wrapper for SQLite database for other apps to store settings.
    - SystemUpdaterSample (`com.example.android.systemupdatersample`) app version `12`
      - Looks like an update manager capable of downloading OTAs. Expects `config.json` or `update.zip` files, and switching slots (A/B) to boot the device from a new slot after a successful update.
    - zxw360 (`com.fibocom.multicamera`) app version `1.1.0.230529.1027`
      - The app is called "360 panorama" and it seems like software to handle a 360 camera hardware. Requires activation code, supports 1080P, full-screen display, handling storage and formatting FAT32 SD cards, pre-allocating storage space, calibration, upgrading car models from USB flash disks, stuff like that.
  - in `system/product/app`:
    - ApkInstall (`com.szchoiceway.apkinstall`) app version `1.0._20230706-11:22:23`
      - "One click install" and "One click uninstall"

      - "Put the apk file to be copied in the `apk_cn` or `apk_en` directory of the U disk and put the multimedia files in the `media` directory of the U disk."
    - BTSuite (`com.szchoiceway.btsuite`) app version `1.0-2023-07-12:09-58`
      - Similar purpose as KSW's `KswBt` app
      - Called "Bluetooth phone" with "BT music", "Call record", "Contacts", "Dial Pad", "BT Pair"
      - UI supports `ad2324`, `benz`, `bwmid8`, `dz` and `landrover`
    - CustomerUI (`com.szchoiceway.customerui`) app version `1.0`
      - Seems like the main launcher, like KSWPLauncher
      - "APK installer", "Browser", "Bluetooth phone", "Touch to connect bluetooth", "Contacts", "Dashboard", "File manager", "Multimedia", "Navigation", "Vehicle information", "Background settings", "Weather"

          ```java
          gpscard_dir = "/storage/external_sd0/";
          mediacard_dir = "/storage/external_sd/";
          card_dir = "/storage/external_sd/";

    - VideoPlayer (`com.szchoiceway.videoplayer`) app version `1.0-2023-06-25:16-13`

    - zxwmedia (`com.szchoiceway.zxwmedia`) app version `1.0-2023-03-08:17-40`

- There's a `product/app/CarType.xml` with the same style configuration like KSW's `factory_config.xml` file, although it only has a handful of sections in comparison to what we know. It appears that it's the default/backup configuration that can be overridden with `OEM/zxw_factory_config.xml`:

  - `SupportUIList` with just `UI_EVO_ID7` (ID `16`)
  - `SupportNaviAppList`
  - `SupportDvrAppList`
  - `CarDisplayParam`
  - `CANBusProtocol`

- Ability to load files from USB disk:
  - `OEM/logo.bmp`
  - `OEM/bootanimiation.zip`
  - `OEM/zxw_factory_config.xml`

- They seem to have additional label to perhaps replace our infamous "Phone is starting" text `<string name="android_start_title_zxw">Android is starting…</string>`

- NTP server is set to `ntp2.aliyun.com` (Alibaba Cloud) rather than `time.android.com`

- There is no "MCU Restart" option

- Status bar on KSW seems to have extra four labels for icons that presumably ZXW does not display: Bluetooth, HD/SD (screen definition) and USB.

- You can change USB charging current, presumably for devices connected to this head unit. By default, it's 1000mA, and it supports values of 0,500,1000,1500,2100,2400,3000.

- Seems to be using `xs9922b0` which appears to be a CHIPUP XS9922B video decoding chip supporting 1080p@30fps.

- Customer name is set to `科赛威` (`Kosavi`)
