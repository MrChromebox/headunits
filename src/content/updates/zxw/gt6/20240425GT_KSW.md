Summary:
- New theme [`KSW_AUDI_PORSCHE`](../../../themes/zxw/43-ksw_audi_porsche): `<Item id="43" ui="KSW_AUDI_PORSCHE" />`
- UI license activation checks through a file (or online service as a fallback)
- MCU upgrade files are now verified for corruption before installation

Changes since `20240406GT_KSW`:
- Added UI activation verification with a license file under `/mnt/privdata1/activation/LicenseData_{BrandUiName}.lic` or through a fallback online service on ZXW servers under POST `https://devices.cosciv.com/ksw/machineRecord/activate`. If verification fails, default UI (ID7) will be set.
- Bluetooth app added "BT Upgrade" functionality; added buttons to manage Bluetooth volume (on ID8 and Land Rover themes)
- New factory config option "LCD CLK Polarity" (`lcdClkPolarity` in XML)
- New factory config option `replaceVersionWith8953` in XML, whereby firmware will check `/mnt/privdata1/btName.txt` file and based on its contents swap the `GT6` part of version text to show `8953` instead
- Music player should now support BMW ID6 theme
- MCU upgrade files are now verified and users will see `MCU upgrade file is damaged!` message if the sum of all bytes in the file (excluding last 4 bytes) does not match the value stored in the last 4 bytes of the file
