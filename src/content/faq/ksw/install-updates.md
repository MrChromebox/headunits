question: 'How to install OTA firmware updates?'
---

1. Download suitable firmware OTA update
2. Compare the file signatures with values from [Updates](../updates/ksw) page (if available) to make sure file is not corrupted
3. Copy the ZIP archive directly to the root of the USB drive
4. Plug in the USB drive into Head Unit (if you have two USB connectors, use the one without CarPlay label)
